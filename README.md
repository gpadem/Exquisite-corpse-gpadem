# In a Spooky House
There was a house in the middle of the lake.
Inside was a light that never went out.
People on the mainland could not reach the house.

They tried but each time they got close the light turn them mad.
No one has ever returned.
But as of late, there now is a second light ...

Still nobody wanted to try to go there again ...
But one day, a mysterious boy came and threw a pair of glasses and then disappeared.
Someone put it on, and was suddently not disturbed anymore by that light coming from the house, and so decided to head towards it ...
